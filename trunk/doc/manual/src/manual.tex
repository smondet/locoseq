\section{Presentation}

\href{http://locoseq.googlecode.com}{Locoseq} is a midi sequencer designed for
live playing looping tracks.  You can create control tracks (called
"meta-tracks") that drive the sequencer (schedule track \textit{x}, mute,
change tempo...) and you can configure how the sequencer reacts on a given
input (midi-in port or keyboard).


The application is build on top of the alsa sequencer API, it is written in
\href{http://www.ocaml.org}{ocaml}
(except the code wrapping asoundlib) and uses GTK+ and glade
(\href {http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/lsl/lablgtk.html}{lablgtk2})
for its GUI.

The source code is available under a classic MIT license (see
\ref{sec:copyright}).



\section{Installation And Usage}

\subsection{Requirements}

For the moment, let's talk about ubuntu packages as the project is developed
under ubntustudio. Those pakages should make you download all needed
dependencies:

\ShellCmd{ apt-get install libasound2-dev libxml-light-ocaml-dev omake
ocaml-findlib liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev }


\begin{lstlisting}
let y f g = 
match f with
| 0 -> "lskdj"
| _ -> "lklkj"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Build}

Just type:

\ShellCmd{omake}

\subsection{Use}

Launch the application:

\ShellCmd{./src/locoseq gui}

\subsection{Examples}
In the test directory:

\begin{verbatim}
\__ test
 |  \__ one_song.xml
 |  \__ tracks.mid
\end{verbatim}

The xml is a "whole" song (open with "Open").  The mid is a midifile containing
some tracks (import with "Add" in the midi-tracks view), it has been made with
\href{http://www.filter24.org/seq24/}{seq24}.

It's just for testing, it should render something more or less audible with a
classical General Midi setup (\textit{e.g.} some FluidSynth with a common
soundfont).

\subsection{If it does not work}

This software is still under heavy development. If you detect problems please
send an e-mail to the developers. If you can, send them also the result of the
portability inspection (\ref{sec:inspect}).


\section{Development}

\subsection{Portability Inspection}
\label{sec:inspect}

To generate some debug information for the developers simply type (you will see
many errors in the term):

\ShellCmd{omake inspection}

then, you can:

\ShellCmd{\$BROWSER InspectionData/Inspection.xhtml}

or

\ShellCmd{man InspectionData/Inspection.man}

And send the file \FileName{InspectionData/Inspection.t2t} to the developers.

\subsection{Standard Midi File Debug}
You can dump a midi file:

\ShellCmd{./src/locoseq parse <midi\_file>}

\subsection{The file util.env}
The command:

\ShellCmd{. util/util.env}

should be useful as it gives some functions:
\texttt{mk}, \texttt{cln}, \texttt{svns} (colorized \texttt{'svn stat -u'}) and
\texttt{docbro} (open ocamlbrowser with many libs).

\subsection{Development Tools}
In addition to ocaml distribution and omake:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the RAD tool used is \texttt{glade-3} (with special
  \textit{semi-compiler} \texttt{lablgladecc2})
  \item for inspection reports (\ref{sec:inspect}) we use
  \href{http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/}{txt2tags}
  \item for licence header management we use \texttt{headache}
  \item this documentation is built with \LaTeX2e\ and 
  \href{http://hevea.inria.fr/}{Hevea}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}

\subsubsection{README file}

\FileName{doc/manual/README.t2t} is the minimal documentation, to
generate, text and XHTML, just type:

\ShellCmd{omake readme}

\subsubsection{Manual}

To generate the manual (pdf and HTML):

\ShellCmd{omake doc}
