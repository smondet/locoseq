  1. Presentation
  ===============

Locoseq (http://locoseq.googlecode.com) is a midi sequencer designed for live
playing looping tracks.  You can create control tracks (called "meta-tracks")
that drive the sequencer (schedule track x, mute, change tempo...) and you
can configure how the sequencer reacts on a given input (midi-in port or
keyboard). 

The application is build on top of the alsa sequencer API, it is written in
ocaml (http://www.ocaml.org) (except the code wrapping asoundlib) and uses GTK+
and glade
(lablgtk2 (http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/lsl/lablgtk.html))
for its GUI.

The source code is available under a classic MIT license.


  2. Installation And Usage
  =========================


	2.1. Requirements
	=================

For the moment, let's talk about ubuntu packages as the project is developed
under ubntustudio. Those pakages should make you download all needed
dependencies:


  apt-get install libasound2-dev libxml-light-ocaml-dev omake ocaml-findlib \
   liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev



	2.2. Build
	==========

Just type:


  omake



	2.3. Use
	========

Launch the application:


  ./src/locoseq gui



	2.4. Examples
	=============

In the test directory:


  \__ test
   |  \__ one_song.xml
   |  \__ tracks.mid

The xml is a "whole" song (open with "Open").
The mid is a midifile containing some tracks (import with "Add" in the
midi-tracks view), it has been made with seq24 (http://www.filter24.org/seq24/).

It's just for testing, it should render something more or less audible with a
classical General Midi setup (e.g. some FluidSynth with a common
soundfont).


	2.5. If it does not work
	========================

This software is still under heavy development. If you detect problems please
send an e-mail to the developers. If you can, send then also the result of the
portability inspection (#inspect).


  3. Debug
  ========


	3.1. Portability Inspection
	===========================

To generate some debug information for the developers simply type (you will see
many errors in the term):


  omake inspection

then, you can:


  $BROWSER InspectionData/Inspection.xhtml

or


  man InspectionData/Inspection.man

And send the file InspectionData/Inspection.t2t to the developers.


	3.2. Standard Midi File Debug
	=============================

You can dump a midi file:


  ./src/locoseq parse <midi_file>
