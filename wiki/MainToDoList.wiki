=== Bugs: ===

 * portability issues: on one machine, I see that RTC timer is not well openned ('time out on poll')
 * meta events bigger than tracks are not banned -> GUI
 * something is wrong in tracker automata when schedduling twice
 * in `alsa_interface.c` "output pool size" should be decided or parametrized

   *  maybe create mli's ?
   * *done* a CSS for code documentation
 * make up documentation framework
   * *done* OMakefile for pdflatex and htmlByHevea
   * *done* \filename
   * *done* \ShellcmdWithResult (but cannot use verbatim, and fancyvrb seems incompatible with hevea)
   * \OptionDescr
